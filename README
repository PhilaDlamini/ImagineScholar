A social networking application built for the Imagine Scholar organization of South Africa. 

The app helps alumni learn about current events at Imagine Scholar, connect with current Imagine Scholars for mentorship opportunities, and share exciting updates in their lives with the rest of the organization. For current scholars, the app helps them keep up with day-to-day tasks at Imagine Scholar.

Imagine Scholar is built with SwiftUI and will be a free download in the App Store later this year.
